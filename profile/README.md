## Welcome to the Nova Ecosystem!

We are an open-source community building the **open-source operating system for a circular economy.**

Our mission is to engineer the interconnected pillars—from finance and AI to materials and agriculture—needed to transition our planet to a sustainable, circular model. The Nova Ecosystem is stewarded by [Circular Engineering Nova GmbH](https://circular.engineering/).

### 🏗️ Our Architecture

Our ecosystem is built on two layers that work together to create a full-stack solution. All repositories are prefixed (e.g., `hub-`, `agro-`) to match their pillar.

#### 1. Enabler Pillars (The "Operating System")
The horizontal "OS" providing the core infrastructure for the entire economy.

* **`auth-` (Identity):** The unified "passport" for trusted identity (SSO, KYC).
* **`hub-` (Novahub):** The central collaboration engine for projects and partners.
* **`finance-` (Novafinance):** The capital engine for green loans, bonds, and ESG finance.
* **`markets-` (Novatrade):** The trading backbone for circular commodities (e.g., carbon credits, recycled materials).
* **`ai-` (Novasapien):** The intelligence layer providing AI, IoT, and digital twin modules.
* **`energy-` (Novaelectron):** The power grid for renewable energy, storage, and smart grids.
* **`material-` (Novamaterial):** The R&D lab for sustainable materials and recycling tech.
* **`mobility-` (Novamobility):** The logistics network for EV fleets and reverse logistics.
* **`infra-` (Novainfra):** The physical backbone for circular industrial parks and waste hubs.
* **`skills-` (Novaskills):** The human capital engine for training and "circular job" certifications.
* **`policy-` (Novapolicy):** The "rulebook" setting the standards for governance and compliance.
* **`balance-` (Novabalance):** The environmental auditor (the "E" in ESG) for tracking carbon, water, and waste.
* **`equity-` (Novaequity):** The social auditor (the "S" in ESG) for tracking fair labor, health, and community impact.

#### 2. Sector Pillars (The "Applications")
The vertical "apps" where the enablers are applied to specific industries.

* **`agro-` (Novaagro):** Regenerative agriculture and food systems.
* **`water-` (Novawater):** Water purification, recycling, and smart irrigation.
* **`build-` (Novabuild):** Circular construction and smart "buildings-as-material-banks."
* **`textile-` (Novatextile):** Fiber-to-fiber recycling and circular fashion models.
* **`waste-` (Novawaste):** Resource recovery, e-waste mining, and waste-to-value processing.
* **`air-` (Novaair):** Air quality monitoring, pollution control, and carbon capture systems.
* **`health-` (Novahealth):** Circular healthcare, medical device recycling, and preventative wellness.

### 🚀 How to Get Involved

We welcome contributors of all kinds—from code and documentation to design and policy standards. The best place to start is our main [Contribution Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Finding Your Way
With over 20 pillars, the best way to find a project is to:

1.  **Browse the pillars above:** See which area interests you most.
2.  **Explore repositories:** All repos match their pillar prefix (e.g., `hub-`, `agro-`, `finance-`).
3.  **Filter by topic:** We use topics like `pillar-hub`, `sector-agro`, and `help-wanted` to organize work.
