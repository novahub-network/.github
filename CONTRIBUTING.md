## Contributing to the NovaHub Network
First off, thank you for considering contributing! It's people like you that make the NovaHub Network such a great community. Your contributions help us build the digital framework for a circular economy.

This document is a high-level guide for contributing to any project within the NovaHub Network organization. For technical, repository-specific instructions (like how to run tests), please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file within that specific repository.

Before participating, please read our [Code of Conduct Guide](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Finding Something to Work On
We value all types of contributions, not just code. Hereâ€™s how to find a task that fits your skills:
* ðŸ’» For Code Contributions: The best place to start is the Issues tab in our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/repositories). We use labels like good first issue to mark tasks that are great for newcomers.
* ðŸŽ¨ For Non-Code Contributions (Design, Docs, Marketing): Our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/vJTgvXQb/p-novahub-network-development) is the best place to find and claim non-code tasks.

### The Contribution Workflow
1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes (git checkout -b my-new-feature).
4. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
5. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
6. Open a Pull Request back to the original repository.

A maintainer will review your pull request and provide feedback. Thank you again for your contribution!
