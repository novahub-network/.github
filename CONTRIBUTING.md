## Finding something to work on

Our product management is fully integrated into GitHub for transparency and collaboration.

- Have a new idea or feature request? Start in [Product Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/discussions/).  
- Ready to contribute? All actionable tasks are tracked on the public [Product Development Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/projects/1).

How to find a task that fits your skills:
- **Look for ready tasks:** Check the ✅ Ready column on our [Kanban Workflow](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/projects/1/views/4). These issues are fully scoped, prioritized, and ready for a contributor to pick up.  
- **Start with “Good First Issues 🌱”:** If you're new to the project, begin with our [Good First Issues](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/projects/1/views/6). These are simple, well‑scoped tasks ideal for newcomers.  
- **Filter by your skills using labels:**
  - **needs: docs 📝** → Requires technical writing or documentation updates.
  - **needs: design 🖌️** → Requires UX/UI design input.
  - **needs: dev 💻** → Requires coding or engineering expertise.
  - **needs: expert-input 🎯** → Needs input from a subject matter expert.
  - **needs: legal 📜** → Requires legal or compliance review.
  - **needs: pm 📊** → Requires product management input for scope/clarity.
- **Look for “help wanted 🤝”:** These issues are open for contribution — maintainers explicitly welcome external help.
