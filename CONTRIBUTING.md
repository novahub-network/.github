### Finding Something to Work On
Our project management is fully integrated into GitHub to provide maximum transparency for our community.
* Have a new idea or feature request? The best place to start is in our (). This is where we brainstorm and refine proposals before they become actionable tasks.
* Ready to contribute? All actionable tasks are tracked on our public [GitHub Development Board](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/projects/1).

To find a task that fits your skills:
* **Look for ready tasks:** Check the ‚úÖ Ready column on our [Kaban Workflow](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/projects/1/views/4). These issues are fully scoped, prioritized, and ready for a contributor to pick up.
* **Start with "Good First Issues":** If you're new to the project, the best place to start is our [Good First Issues ‚úÖ](https://github.com/orgs/novahub-network/projects/1/views/6). These are tasks specifically chosen to be welcoming for newcomers.
* **Filter by your skills:** You can filter the board by labels that match your expertise, such as **needs: docs ‚úçÔ∏è**, **needs: design üé®**, or **needs: dev üë©‚Äçüíª**.

### The Code Contribution Workflow
1. Fork the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes (git checkout -b my-new-feature).
4. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
5. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
6. Open a Pull Request back to the original repository.

A maintainer will review your pull request and provide feedback. Thank you again for your contribution!
